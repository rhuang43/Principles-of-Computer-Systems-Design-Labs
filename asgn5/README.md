I referenced vinces pseudocode and his section notes to make the clock policy. The files I implemented were List.c and List.h which were lifted from my project assignment during my time in CSE101. I modified this to incorperate reference bits for the clock policy. I then implemented FIFO and LRU in addition to CLOCK policy caches in cacher.c which contains the main file to execute. I also implemented a clock hand node to keep track on where I was to move the cursor to delete as the delete function god damn nukes the cursor to null/void making it hard to keep track as when I try to reset the cursor with just a place holder index my code goes EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH WHAT IS DIIIIIIIIIIS..... I hate C...
